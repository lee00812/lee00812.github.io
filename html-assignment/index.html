            <p>Why am I studying Interactive Media Design?</p>
            <p>The reason I am taking this course is I would like to get more hands-on experience in <sup>(1)</sup>digital design and <sup>(2)</sup>coding development, hence, to enable me to move on to the next level in my career. I have been working in Digital Marketing for over 6 years with international brands. Have experience in working with digital designers and external developers to build marketing campaigns, mini game, or site enhancement to improve customer experience as well as numbers. I like the nature of this industry, like the mobility of this job as well as it keeps me up with marketing trends.</p>
